<h1>About Me</h1>

  Growing up I wanted to pursue a career in Medicine but then when I got to see the realities that medical professionals face I decided not to look somewhere else. 
  I have a cousin who did IT in varsity who was always passionate about this career path as a software developer.
   That is what got me curious as to why is a bunch of complicated words on a computer screen so interesting to him which is essentially what landed me in Software Development.
